### 1. WARP is a multi-functional one-click script that supports direct installation of pure IPV4 and pure IPV6 VPS, and is supported by mainstream Linux systems.
```
bash <(wget -qO- https://gitlab.com/rwkgyg/CFwarp/raw/main/CFwarp.sh 2> /dev/null)
```
or
```
bash <(curl -Ls https://gitlab.com/rwkgyg/CFwarp/raw/main/CFwarp.sh)
```

Note: For a VPS that has installed warp, if other scripts fail to run and download, and the script interface cannot be entered, please try the following shortcut to terminate the warp.

  1. Terminate warp-go:
  ```kill -15 $(pgrep warp-go)```

  2. Terminate wgcf:
  ```systemctl stop wg-quick@wgcf```
